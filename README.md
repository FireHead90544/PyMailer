### Tasks List

- [ ] Update README with usage instructions and info

### Usage:
**NOTE: These aren't proper instructions, but just there to suffice the necessity till I update the readme properly as I am lazy to do so :)**
1. Clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FireHead90544/PyMailer
```
2. CD to the directory that just got cloned.
```bash
cd PyMailer
```
4. Install the requirements.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the file. Maybe?
```bash
python main.py
```


### Screenshots
**Just there for showing how actually it looks (flex ofc), I will update this later too**

***And yes, Use app passwords to login to the smtp server (in case if smtp server is google) or else waste your time enabling lesssecureapps and unlocking display captcha and using normal account password lol. And keep waiting for the readme to be updated by me xD***
